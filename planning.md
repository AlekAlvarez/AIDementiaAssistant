Program Layout
User interacts with a Speech Recognition Program which turns their questions into text input. 
This then is analyzed by NLP functions on Gemni API and a text response is generated by the NLP.
This is then output using text to speech so the user can easily understand.

The Natural Language Processing Model Data oringally is from data provided by a users caregivers,
but hopefully as a user/patient interacts with the program they can input data while they talk 
to the assitant.
