TIDAL TAMU Hackathon Project Repo

Functionality:
This program supports dementia patients by helping them stay on track with their daily routines, offering reminders for upcoming activities and providing easy access to past information. It also tracks the patient's mood - between disturbed, neutral, or cheerful - and calls for assistance if the patient is feeling disturbed. The program efficiently manages their schedule and is capable of immediately answering repetitive questions about their life, ensuring they feel informed throughout the day.
